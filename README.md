# Text Generation Exercise with Keras

Training a text generation model with Keras.

## Description

Using the Deep Learning with Python text as a guide, I train an LTSM text generator using Keras. For this exercise, I trained the LTSM (long short-term memory) neural network on 
the classic text, War of the Worlds. I then pick a starting point in the text and use the model to generate the following words. I recorded the output using 4 different temperatures and 
at epochs 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

## Data
